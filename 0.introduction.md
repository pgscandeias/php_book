# Writing Partymapper

## Overview

I'll be coding a simple backend in php, using an onion architecture for my business logic, a command pattern to expose use cases, and test-driven development throughout to ensure quality and maintainability.

In many ways this adheres to the principles laid out by Uncle Bob in his talk "Architecture: the lost years", in which he argues against tying logic to a particular web framework.

## Background

On a recent trip to London I installed Nightmapper, a little iphone app that shows parties happening nearby. I have yet to find a better app for when I'm out and about with no idea where to go next.

Its user experience is amazing. There's a map, centered on your location, with a bunch of pins representing parties happening that night. A black bar at the bottom screen tells you everything you need to know to decide whether or not you might be interested: party name, opening and closing times, admission price, and how far away it is. Location is key here: the first party you see is the one closest to your location. You can tap the bar to get a lot more information, or you can swipe left and right to change party. They're sorted by distance to you, which is great. 

Back in Berlin I attacked the app store in search of something similar, but no luck. Most nightlife apps just plain suck, and the decent ones come nowhere near the UX of Nightmapper. What's a programmer to do??

### The plan

I need:

- A **backend** with an events database and an API. I can code this myself.
- An **app**. I never made an ios app before. I can either learn, use Phonegap or get someone to do it.
- A **data source**. No way I'm manually adding events or hoping venues cooperate with me out of the kindness of their hearts. More on this later.

Let's focus on the backend, because this is a series on php after all.

In the old days I'd whip out a framework, create a data model with mysql or postgres in mind, put logic in the controllers - or in services if I was feling fancy - and I was off to the races.

That's how most software is made these days, and it's also why most software is full of bugs that take forever to fix.
