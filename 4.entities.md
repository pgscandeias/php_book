# Writing Partymapper

## Entities

Yes! Finally some code.

I like to start by just implementing my domain entities, looking at them, getting a feel for how they actually interact.

There's no point in writing tests here, because there's no logic to speak of. Any syntax errors, namespace issues and missed accessors will be caught by testing other units of our code that use these.

I'll write them the Doctrine way, with protected properties and public accessors. This is way more verbose than just declaring public properties in a class, but it's better for the following reasons:

1. It gives you total control over your data structure
2. See reason `1`

As much as I appreciate dynamically typed languages, there's value in strongly typed code. Accessors let you harness typehints to ensure data consistency. They also enable you to transform your data any way you see fit. That often comes in handy.

Also, I've already decided I'll be using Doctrine for my persistence layer implementation. I avoid letting implementation details influence my domain design, but because of reason `1`, above, turns out I'm not really violating that principle. I love when things work out well.

Incoming walls of code!

### Event

```php
<?php
// src/Entity/Event.php
namespace Partymapper\Entity;

use DateTime;
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;

class Event
{
    /**
     * @var int
     */
    protected $id;

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $name;

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $description;

    /**
     * @var Venue
     */
    protected $venue;

    /**
     * @var DateTime
     */
    protected $start;

    /**
     * @var DateTime
     */
    protected $end;

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $image;

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $url;

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $ticketPurchaseUrl;

    /**
     * @var ArrayCollection<Price>
     */
    protected $prices;

    /**
     * @var ArrayCollection<Tag>
     */
    protected $tags;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->tags = new ArrayCollection;
        $this->prices = new ArrayCollection;
    }

    public function setId($id)
    {
        $this->id = $id;
        return $this;
    }

    public function getId()
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    public function setName($name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        return $this;
    }

    public function getName()
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function setDescription($description)
    {
        $this->description = $description;
        return $this;
    }

    public function getDescription()
    {
        return $this->description;
    }

    public function setVenue(Venue $venue)
    {
        $this->venue = $venue;
        return $this;
    }

    public function getVenue()
    {
        return $this->venue;
    }

    public function setStart(DateTime $start)
    {
        $this->start = $start;
        return $this;
    }

    public function getStart()
    {
        return $this->start;
    }

    public function setEnd(DateTime $end)
    {
        $this->end = $end;
        return $this;
    }

    public function getEnd()
    {
        return $this->end;
    }

    public function setImage($image)
    {
        $this->image = $image;
        return $this;
    }

    public function getImage()
    {
        return $this->image;
    }

    public function setUrl($url)
    {
        $this->url = $url;
        return $this;
    }

    public function getUrl()
    {
        return $this->url;
    }

    public function setTicketPurchaseUrl($ticketPurchaseUrl)
    {
        $this->ticketPurchaseUrl = $ticketPurchaseUrl;
        return $this;
    }

    public function getTicketPurchaseUrl()
    {
        return $this->ticketPurchaseUrl;
    }

    public function addPrice(Price $price)
    {
        $this->prices->add($price);
        $price->setEvent($this);
        return $this;
    }

    public function removePrice(Price $price)
    {
        $this->prices->remove($price);
        return $this;
    }

    public function getPrices()
    {
        return $this->prices;
    }

    public function addTag(Tag $tag)
    {
        $this->tags->add($tag);
        return $this;
    }

    public function removeTag(Tag $tag)
    {
        $this->tags->remove($tag);
        return $this;
    }

    public function getTags()
    {
        return $this->tags;
    }
}
```

A few points of interest:

```php
// src/Entity/Event.php
```
I don't really write this bit in my files. You'll see these lines at the top of files in this series, but it's merely for your benefit. I've seen people write this in their actual code, and I think it's a bit silly. I mean, you're not using notepad, are you? Your editor can take care of showing you the file's location if you so desire.

```php
public function __construct()
{
    $this->tags = new ArrayCollection;
    $this->prices = new ArrayCollection;
}
```

Always initialize your collections. **Always**.

```php
public function addPrice(Price $price)
{
    $this->prices->add($price);
    $price->setEvent($this); // link them entities
    return $this;
}
```

If this doesn't make sense, break abstraction for a while and imagine a relational database. You have an `events` table and a `prices` table. In `prices` there's a foreign key: column `prices.event_id` pointing to `events.id`. When you create a price, you need to set that foreign key, right? That's what's happening here. You're adding a `Price` to an `Event` and telling it "hey, Price, you belong to this Event", because `Price` is the one who knows who it belongs to. In Doctrine parlance, Price *owns* the relationship.

### Price

```php
<?php
// src/Entity/Price.php
namespace Partymapper\Entity;

class Price
{
    /**
     * @var Event
     */
    protected $event;

    /**
     * Description of this price tier
     * @var string
     */
    protected $name;

    /**
     * Price in cents
     * @var int
     */
    protected $amount;

    /**
     * Currency ISO 4217 code (3 letter, ex: EUR)
     * @var string
     */
    protected $currency;

    // Here there be accessors 
}
```

Ok, I confess. Something's been nagging me for a while now: having a *description* called `name` is silly. Let's change that now:

```php
/**
 * @var string
 */
protected $description;

...

public function setDescription($description)
{
    $this->description = $description;
    return $this;
}

public function getDescription()
{
    return $this->description;
}
```

Bonus points: the docblock comment is rendered unnecessary due to the amazingly descriptive new name of our property. I maintain that code itself is the best documentation. Comments rot. I mostly use docblocks for the `@var`, `@param`, `@throws` and `@return` statements. Only when there's no way of expressing intent through variable and method names will I write down an actual coment.


### Tag

```php
<?php
// src/Entity/Tag.php
namespace Partymapper\Entity;

class Tag
{
    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $id;

    // Here there be accessors
}
```

The text in a tag is its own identifier, so no point in giving this entity any more properties.

Why even make it an entity at all? Because something looking simple in the beginning does not guarantee it'll stay simple forever. Let's not be lazy! Let's keep our options open.


### Venue

```php
<?php
// src/Entity/Venue.php
namespace Partymapper\Entity;

use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;

class Venue
{
    /**
     * @var int
     */
    protected $id;

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $name;

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $description;

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $image;

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $url;

    /**
     * @var Address
     */
    protected $address;

    /**
     * @var ArrayCollection<Event>
     */
    protected $events;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->events = new ArrayCollection;
    }

    // Here there be accessors
}
```

Not exactly rocket science.


### Address

```php
<?php
// src/Entity/Address.php
namespace Partymapper\Entity;

class Address
{
    /**
     * @var int
     */
    protected $id;

    /**
     * Raw address contents, as obtained from sources
     * @var string
     */
    protected $raw;

    /**
     * @var float
     */
    protected $latitude;

    /**
     * @var float
     */
    protected $longitude;

    // Here there be drag... I mean, accessors
}
```

What happened here?? My original plan was to have `Address` contain very nicely normalized data!

Research and thought happened. I realized my likely sources won't give me nicely normalized address data. I plan on letting third parties handle geocoding, using software whoe sole job is to parse addresses, so I'll save myself some trouble and delegate to them.


### Entities done

Right! Let's move on.
